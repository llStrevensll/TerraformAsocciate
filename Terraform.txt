Terraform IaC
Infrastructure as Code or IaC is the management and provisioning if IT infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files.

==============================================
export aws credentials

-------------------

terraform init
This command performs several different initialization steps in order to prepare a working directory for use.

Initialize terraform, download everything that we need in order to actually run this configuration.
-------------------
terraform validate
command validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.

--------------------
terraform plan
command is used to create an execution plan, terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.

This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state.
